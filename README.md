# odin-recipes

This was an exercise from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

The skills demonstrated show how to effectively build local repositories, utilizing git, coding in basic HTML, and adding links and images to HTML files.

Much of the HTML tasks were familiar, however this was a great project to further develop an understanding of git. Specifically, practice setting up local repositories, and how to effectively add, commit, and push changes from the command line.
