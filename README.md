# odin-recipes

This was an exercise from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) lpar;TOPrpar;.

The skills demonstrated are effectively building local repositories, utilizing git, coding in basic HTML, and adding links and images to HTML files.

Much of the HTML tasks were familiar, however this was a great project to further develop an understanding of git. Specifically, practice setting up local repositories, and effectively add, commit, and push changes from the command line.

## CSS Update

During the CSS portion of TOP's assignments, a task was to update the original HTML markup and add basic styling. It was a good practice reviewing The Box Model, and block and inline elements.
